# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes explanations, examples, and visual aids to understand and document software requirements effectively.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional needs of a software system. It involves communication with stakeholders, analysis of user needs, and transforming them into formal documentation.
It plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as it ensures the development team understands what needs to be built, reducing the risk of rework and project failure.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Improves Clarity and Understanding**: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system requirements.
Reduces Rework**: Early clarification of requirements helps minimize costly changes during later development phases.
Enhances Planning**: Accurate requirements enable better project planning, estimation, and risk management.
